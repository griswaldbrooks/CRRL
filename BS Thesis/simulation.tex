\chapter{Simulation}
Algorithm development and robot simulation was done in MATLAB. The simulation constructed a virtual environment using line segments and approximated the robot as a point on the plane. The kinematic model of the robot was taken as a differential drive robot, as modeling the full kinematics of the Nao robot was not necessary to the efficacy of the algorithm. A basic approximation for inertia was made by low pass filtering all velocity commands. Motion noise was injected by adding uniform random noise between zero and one, which was then scaled by a constant, to the linear and angular velocities. The resultant velocities were integrated to gain robot position using RK4 integration.
The sonar beams were approximated as cones in the plane with the sensor model returning the distance to the closest object within the region of the cone. These ranges were also perturbed by uniform random noise before being returned to the navigation algorithm.
